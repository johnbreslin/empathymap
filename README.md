Empathy Map File(s)
-------------------
Why aren't there easy-to-reuse Empathy Map files for Design Thinking purposes? I was frustrated looking for some earlier on today, so I went and made my own, and now here they are.

Available as PDF, EPS, SVG and AI.

Credit me if you want, but these images are all available under a CC0 license, so no attribution is necessary.
