Empathy Map Template(s)
-----------------------
Why isn't there an easy-to-reuse Empathy Map template for Design Thinking purposes? I was frustrated looking for one earlier on today, so I went and made my own, and now here it is. 

Available as PDF, EPS, SVG and AI.

Credit me if you want, but these images are all available under a CC0 license, so no attribution is necessary.

Source(s) and inspiration(s): The empathy map worksheet was part of the instructional materials for the Stanford University online course Design Thinking Action Lab, taught by Leticia Britos Cavagnaro in 2013 on the NovoEd platform (https://novoed.com/designthinking/). Credit to David Grey for the original empathy map framework. More context on the use of empathy map as part of a design thinking toolkit can be found at http://dschool.stanford.edu/use-our-methods/.
